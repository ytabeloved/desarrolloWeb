                        There are two ways to think about remodeling projects that will boost your home’s value; you can
                        get one or two major remodels done or opt for a bunch of small fixes. Depending on your budget
                        and your timetable, one approach may be better for you than the other.

                        For instance, if you have an unfinished basement, maybe your dream when you first moved into
                        your home was to refinish it. It never happened. But now that you are thinking about selling
                        your home, you feel that a prospective buyer would really appreciate a full finished basement.
                        Is that the remodeling project that you should do before selling?

                        On the other hand, you want to spend as little as possible to squeeze as much value out of your
                        home. Maybe you would prefer to just spruce up the kitchen cabinets or repaint the house.
                        Whichever camp you fall into here are some remodeling project ideas that usually add at least a
                        few thousand dollars to the value of your home.
